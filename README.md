About GooseTowerDefense (GooseTDS), Developed by Samuel Zhu and Madison Wong

The original game that GooseTDS was referenced from was developed by Sarah Wang and named BTD112. It was made for a term project at 
Carnegie Mellon University. BTD112 is based off of BloonsTD5, a tower defense game developed by 
NinjaKiwi in 2011. GooseTDS is developed in pygame by Samuel Zhu and Madison Wong, for the end of
term project for CHE120.


GooseTDS is a tower defense game where you place professors to help you defend against
the incoming hoard of geese invading the campus. Your professors will try to stop 
the geese at a certain cost, but be warned! They get tired at night, and that's when
the geese strike. There are 2 maps, 20 levels, and you have 18 thousand dollars to work with.
Can you survive all 20 levels to finish the term?
